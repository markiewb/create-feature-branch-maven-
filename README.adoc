= Feature branch helper script for Maven

This Maven integrated script helps you with the tedious tasks of creating feature branches.

The manual execution of tasks like creating a git branch, setting the pom-versions, committing the changed pom.xml can be automated this way. 
 
== Usage

Invoke 
 
   mvn 
   
The script will ask you for the name of the feature branch.

It requires Git and Maven in the PATH.

== FAQ

=== Only `mvn`? No arguments at commandline? 

Yes, it is such simple. A pre-configured `maven-antrun-plugin` configuration is set the default goal. 

More details at https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#BaseBuild_Element 

=== How does it work?

See the sources. It is highly adaptable.
